# Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SR-GAN) Image upsampling
  - Implementation of SRGAN for Tensorflow version.
  - Objective: Enhance the resolution of low-resolution images to produce high-resolution versions while preserving details and realism.
  

## Applications
  Such applications that would be benefitted from the help of "SR-GAN" are:
  1. Image Enhancement: Improve the resolution and quality of images.
  2. Medical Imaging: Enhance resolution in medical scans and images.
  3. Satellite Imagery: Improve resolution for better analysis of geographical features.
  4. Surveillance Cameras: Enhance low-resolution footage for better object and individual identification.
  5. Art Restoration: Restore details and resolution in old or damaged artworks and photographs.
  6. Graphics and Design: Enhance image quality in graphic design for various applications.
  7. Face Recognition: Improve facial image quality for better performance in recognition systems.
  8. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): Contribute to better visual quality in VR and AR applications.

## Download repository
  - download this repo by following the given instructions:
  
        $ git clone https://github.com/animeshraghav/SR-GAN-Image-upsampling.git


## Requirements
  - Hardware:
  A relatively powerful GPU is recommended for faster training and inference. SRGAN is computationally intensive, and a GPU can significantly speed up the   process.
  Sufficient RAM to handle the data and model. 16GB or more is recommended.

  - Software:
  Operating System: Windows 10 is recommended.
  Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).
  
  - Setup Steps:
    - Install Anaconda: Download and install Anaconda for managing Python packages and environments.
    - Create a Virtual Environment: Open Anaconda Navigator and create a new virtual environment:
  
            $ conda create --name srgan_env python=3.8
    -  Activate the virtual environment:
            
            $ conda activate srgan_env
    - Install Required Libraries: Install necessary libraries using the following commands:
        
            $ conda install jupyter
            $ pip install tensorflow matplotlib opencv-python
    - Download SRGAN Jupyter Notebook: Clone or download the SRGAN Jupyter Notebook from the respective repository.
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook: Navigate to the folder where you saved the SRGAN notebook using the command line.
    - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
        
            $ jupyter notebook
        This will open a new tab in your web browser. Now, navigate to the SRGAN notebook file and open it.
    - Run the Notebook: Follow the instructions within the notebook to run and experiment with the SRGAN model.
    

        Libraries required:
        1. cv2: Image processing
        2. NumPy: For numerical computations.
        3. Matplotlib: For data visualization.
        4. Pillow: For image manipulation.
        5. TensorFlow: Depending on your chosen deep  learning framework.
    
  **Note:** The above steps provide a general guideline, and you may need to adjust them based on specific details in the **SRGAN notebook** or any changes in dependencies. Always check the notebook's documentation or repository for any additional instructions.
